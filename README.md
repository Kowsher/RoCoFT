# RoCoFT

This is the implementation for the paper "RoCoFT: Efficient Finetuning of Large Language Models with Row-Column Updates".

We explore a set of novel PEFT methods where the fine-tuning is applied on rows and columns of weights of the model.
We  demonstrate  the higher  memroy and time effivency of our method  in comparison with other PEFT methods.
This performance is governed by the less number of parameters selected for  fine-tuning.
Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that the accuracy of  our method is comparable to other PEFT methods.
